# Getting Started Guide


### 1) Start ReadySet

Download and run the ReadySet orchestrator.
Run the following command to download the ReadySet orchestrator.

```Javascript
    bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://launch.readyset.io)"
```


Follow the prompts issued by the orchestrator to configure your ReadySet deployment.
Select a database type (currently, ReadySet supports MySQL and Postgres), set a deployment name and password, and assign ReadySet a port to listen on. From there, the orchestrator will download the ReadySet docker images and spin up a new ReadySet instance locally.

The installer will create and save a docker-compose file, and display where the file has been saved. You will now be asked if you would like to deploy with docker-compose now. If you choose `yes` (recommended) then you will see Docker Compose begin deploying three assets:

1. Consul
2. MySQL or Postgres database
3. ReadySet Adapter


### 2) Connect to ReadySet

#### via SQL client
To connect to ReadySet via the default MySQL or Postgres command line client, run the command that the orchestrator outputs.

in the **MySQL** case:

```Javascript
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p <password> -P <port> --database=<deployment name>
```

in the **Postgres** case:
```Javascript
psql postgresql://postgres:<password>@127.0.0.1:<port>/<deployment name>
```
#### via your application 

To connect ReadySet to your application, replace your database connection string with the connection string provided by the orchestrator.

### 3) Cache Queries in ReadySet

Proxy queries through ReadySet & profile their performance.
By default, all queries sent to ReadySet are proxied to the underlying database. You can see the current list of proxied queries and their performance profiles via the ReadySet dashboard (on `http://localhost:4000`). 

A full explanation of the ReadySet caching syntax is available [here](/using/caching).
