# Connect to Readyset.cloud

Since Readyset.cloud is a cloud managed version of the open source software, the
instructions are identical to connecting to a self hosted version of
ReadySet.

The URL for the ReadySet instance resembles that of a Postgres instance and is
conveniently accessible from the Readyset.cloud page here.

See instructions [here](/get-started/connect)
