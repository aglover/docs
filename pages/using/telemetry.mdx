# Telemetry

ReadySet collects telemetry data to help us diagnose issues and understand how users interact with our product.

This telemetry data is anonymous by default. Users can opt into providing a persistent identifier, or disable telemetry completely.

Telemetry is reported using the [Segment](segment.com) customer data platform.


## Disabling telemetry

Telemetry can be disabled by running the ReadySet installer with the `--disable-telemetry` option, or by setting the `RS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable.


## Providing your own Segment source

By default, ReadySet reports telemetry to an [HTTP Tracking API Source](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/) operated by ReadySet, Inc. A different source can be specified by setting the `RS_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` environment variable to the write key corresponding to the source you wish to use.


## What telemetry data is collected?

Our telemetry reporting system is under active development, so the below details are subject to change.

Telemetry messages adhere to the [Segment Track API spec](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/). Each telemetry message contains a per-session anonymous UUID, an event name, a timestamp, and 0 or more properties. If the `RS_API_KEY` environment variable is set, its value will be used as the user ID.

The following OpenAPI schema describes all possible telemetry payloads reported by ReadySet:
