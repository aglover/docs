# Using the ReadySet Dashboard

## Viewing the Dashboard

After creating a new ReadySet instance via the installer, you can access the dashboard from your web browser by navigating to
 `http://localhost:4000`.

### Port Forwarding
If your ReadySet instance is running on a remote machine, you can use port forwarding to connect to the dashboard. Open up a terminal and run

```Javascript
ssh -N -L 4000:localhost:4000 user@remote-ip-addr-of-machine
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:4000` on your local browser.

## Pages Overview
There are three views in the ReadySet Dashboard. Below is a deeper look at the information available on each page. Each page is accessible via the navigation panels in the top right corner.

### Queries Overview

This page shows a list of proxied and cached queries and their performance in two separate tables. 
- **Query ID:** the ReadySet assigned identifier for proxied queries. Used to cache queries
- **Query Text:** the parameterized text for a query
- **P50 latency (ms):** the performance in milliseconds of the 50th percentile of this query
- **P90 latency (ms):** the performance in milliseconds of the 90th percentile of this query
- **P99 latency (ms):** the performance in milliseconds of the 99th percentile of this query
- **Total Duration (ms):** the sum of the execution time for all executions of this query

### Specific Query
This page shows more detailed information about specific queries to help dig deeper into

- **Query Text:** interpretation of the query text
- **Query Running in ReadySet:** whether the query is being handled by ReadySet or the upstream DB
- **Query Latency:** query end-to-end latency from the time the request is received by ReadySet
- **Total Query Cache Miss Rate:** rate of missing from the query cache
- **Queries Per Second:** number of queries per second executed against ReadySet split by the ReadySet and MySQL backends
- **Cache Hit Rate:** cache hit rate observed at the first layer of ReadySet caches. In the absence of queries this graph shows a cache hit rate of 0%.
- **Cache Eviction Time:** cache eviction runs asynchronously in ReadySet, but can impact the performance of queries that miss at the first layer of caches. This tracks the percent of the last 30 seconds that we spent performing evictions in the cache, reported as the maximum across all caches.

### Status Page
This page shows the current status of ReadySet and key system metrics. 

- **Readyset Started:** how long ago ReadySet processes started
- **Server External Requests:** number of HTTP requests received by the ReadySet server
- **Adapter External Requests:** number of HTTP requests received by the ReadySet adapter
- **Queries Per Second:** rate of queries that ReadySet is receiving
- **Snapshot in Progress:** whether ReadySet is currently snapshotting
- **Migration in Progress:** whether ReadySet is currently running migrations
