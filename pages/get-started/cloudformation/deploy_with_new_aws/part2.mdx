# Part 2: Start using ReadySet 
## Get your ReadySet connection string 
### Step 1: Create a VPC Endpoint and collect its DNS host name
In the AWS console, navigate to **Virtual Private Cloud**, and then **Endpoints**. Click **Create Endpoint**.

Under **Service category**, select **Find service by name** and copy in the `ReadySetMySQLVPCEndpointService` you obtained in Part 1 Step 5. Click **Verify** to confirm that this service is valid. Once verified, the additional fields will be populated for you.

In the VPC field, select the VPC you will be using to send queries to ReadySet. 

Click **Create endpoint** at the bottom of the page. 

Youâ€™ll now be able to view **Details** for the endpoint you just created. Copy the DNS name to use as a part of your database connection string. This is the DNS host name that will resolve to live ReadySet adapters. This DNS host name is only valid inside the VPC you will be sending queries from. 

### Step 2: Accept the VPC Endpoint
In the AWS console, navigate to **Endpoint Services** under **Virtual Private Cloud**. Select the endpoint service that matches the value from `ReadySetMySQLVPCEndpointService` that you obtained in Part 1 Step 5. Then, click the **Endpoint connections** tab. Select the new endpoint that you created in Part 2 Step 1. Click **Actions** and then **Accept endpoint connection request**. 

Navigate back to **Endpoints** under **Virtual Private Cloud** to confirm that the endpoint has been accepted. Once the status for the endpoint is `available`, you can start sending queries to ReadySet!

### Step 3: Connect to ReadySet
Use the DNS host name you collected in Part 2 Step 1 for connecting to ReadySet. This database connection uses the same authentication parameters as the `DatabaseUsername` and `DatabasePassword` you set in the CloudFormation stack. For example, the connection string should look something like `mysql://<DNShostname>/`.

If you are using the command line MySQL client, you can connect to ReadySet by running `mysql -h <DNShostname>`. We recommend using a different instance to test connections, such as an application server, rather than using any individual Adapter or Server instance.


## Notes 
The `KeyPairName` was added to every adapter and server instance which will allow you to SSH into any individual adapter or server instance assuming you have those credentials. This should not need to be done. 

As you use ReadySet, logs are also being uploaded to a CloudWatch Log Group with the name of your ReadySet stack.
