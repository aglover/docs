# ReadySet Installation Guide for PostgreSQL 

This guide walks you through how to run ReadySet using Docker, connecting to an existing primary database.

## 0. Make sure you can connect to your primary database.  

ReadySet needs to be installed on a machine that can communicate with your primary database. To check to make sure that it can, 
you can run the following on that instance:

```sh copy
psql -h <ip address> -p <port> -d <database name which you want to connect> -U <username of the database server>
```

If you are able to successfully make the connection, you should be all set. 

## 1. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and memory for ReadySet 
Any tables referenced by queries that you would like to cache need to be pulled into ReadySet. Before installing ReadySet, 
ensure that the machine that you are installing it on has sufficient disk space and memory to replicate the base tables and 
cache queries. 


<Callout type="info"> Note that by default, ReadySet will pull in all tables from your database. If you only want to pull in specific
tables, you will need to set the `--replication-tables` flag in Step 3.  </Callout>

## 2. Download the ReadySet Docker image
To download the ReadySet Docker image from DockerHub, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh copy
docker pull readysettech/readyset
```

## 3.  Run ReadySet


First, find your primary database's connection string. 

It should look something like this: 

```postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>```

Next, define the list of tables you want to pull into ReadySet as a comma-separated list: 
```<schema>.<table>, <schema>.<table2>```. Note, this is optional - you can import all tables too by ignoring this command line flag.
If you'd like to import all of the tables in a given schema, you can specify everything as follows: ```<schema>.*```. 



**By default, ReadySet will import all tables.**

If you'd like to import all database tables, you can skip passing in this argument. 


Now, you're ready to start ReadySet. In your terminal, run the following command:  

```sh copy
docker run -d -t -i                             \
-p 5433:5433                                    \
-e UPSTREAM_DB_URL=<database connection string> \
-e REPLICATION_TABLES=<your tables>             \
-e LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:5433                  \
readysettech/readyset:latest --standalone
```

As you can see above, ReadySet is set to listen on port 5433. 

For instance, connecting to a locally running docker Postgres and importing all tables 
in the `locution` database would look like this:

```sh
docker run -d -t -t                                                                \
-p 5433:5433                                                                       \
-e UPSTREAM_DB_URL=postgres://postgres:locution@host.docker.internal:5432/locution \
-e LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:5433                                                     \
readysettech/readyset:latest --standalone
```


ReadySet will then connect to your database and replicate the specified tables (or all of your tables if you 
left this option off). Depending on how large these tables
are and the network connection between ReadySet and your database, this could take between seconds and hours. 

To check whether the tables have been imported, run the following: 

```sh copy
docker logs readyset-cache-1
```

While the snapshot is ongoing, you will see many log messages related to snapshotting progress.

Once you see:

```
INFO replicators::noria_adapter: Streaming replication started
```

ReadySet is ready to start caching queries.

## Next Steps

As a next step, you can [connect to ReadySet from a database shell ](/get-started/connect/connect-via-database-shell) or [connect from your application](/get-started/connect/connect-an-application-via-an-orm).
