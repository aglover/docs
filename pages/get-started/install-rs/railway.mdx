# Install ReadySet in Railway

ReadySet can be easily used in [Railway](https://railway.app/)! There's a [handy 
ReadySet template](https://railway.app/template/wr1OLZ) availabe which spins up a Postgres instance along with a connected 
ReadySet instance. Thank you to community member, [Milo](https://railway.app/u/milo), for creating this!
