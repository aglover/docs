# Deploy ReadySet 

You can configure and deploy a ReadySet cluster to a specified AWS account using the ReadySet orchestrator. To download the orchestrator, run:

Currently, ReadySet is only available in AWS to users on our early access list. If you'd like to be on this list, please email `info@readyset.io`.
