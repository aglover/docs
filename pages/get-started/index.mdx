## Workload Requirements
ReadySet should be used for **cacheable workloads**. Cacheable workloads are **read-heavy** with 
**predictable access patterns**. 

#### Read-Heavy Workloads 
Read-heavy workloads are characterized by a high read-to-write ratio. In other words, of the requests
being sent to your database, the vast majority of them are reads rather than writes. 

Caching query results entails computing the result of a query and storing it in memory so that is readily accessible
the next time the same query is issued. Therefore, caching accelerates reads so for your application to see improvements
from caching, it must perform a non-trivial number of reads. 

#### Predictable Access Patterns
Predictable access patterns are another caching prerequisite. This is because most caches (ReadySet included) are populated based on *demand*â€“ 
i.e. the first time a user requests a given key, the result will be computed around stored in memory so that it is available the next time 
the same query is issued. However, if you never issue the same query again, the result will be stored in memory but unused.

## Configuring ReadySet
Similarly, it's important to configure ReadySet in a way that sets yourself up for success. 

There is a notion of a "working set" in caching that
