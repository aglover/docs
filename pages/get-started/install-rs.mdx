# Install ReadySet

These guides walk you through the process for downloading, configuring, and running ReadySet using 
Docker. 

## Database Requirements

For ReadySet to work properly, the following database setttings are required: 
1. Logical replication must be turned on in your database
2. ReadySet must have superuser permissions

For directions on how to check and alter these configurations, please see our 
[database reference documentation](/reference/configure-your-database). The steps to 
configure these settings vary by database 
type and hosting provider. 

## Supported Database Versions

| Database Type | Versions | Support Level |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| PostgreSQL | 13.0+ | Beta |
| MySQL  | 8.0 | Alpha |


## Supported Hosting Providers

|  Hosting Provider | Support Level |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Self-hosted | Beta |
| AWS RDS | Beta |
| AWS Aurora | Beta |
| Azure SQL Database | Alpha |
| GCP SQL | Alpha |


**Beta support** conveys that ReadySet is routinely tested in those contexts. 

**Alpha support** conveys that ReadySet has previously been validated to work in those contexts, but we don't actively check for regressions.
