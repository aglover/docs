# Configure Your Database

As the first step in setting up ReadySet, you will need to check to make sure that your database is configured to work with ReadySet. 

For ReadySet to work, the following must be true: 
1. Logical replication must be turned on in your database
2. ReadySet must be given superuser permissions

The steps to configure these settings vary by database type and hosting provider. You can see the ReadySet supported
databases and hosting providers below. Once you've found the one that matches your database, navigate to the associated
setup guide. 

## Supported Database Versions

| Database Type | Versions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PostgreSQL | 13.0, 14.0 |
| MySQL  | 8.0 |


<Callout type="warning"> ReadySet's MySQL support is in alpha. There is a known list of issues that might block you. </Callout>

## Supported Hosting Providers

|  Hosting Provider | Support Level |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Self-hosted | Beta |
| AWS RDS | Beta |
| AWS Aurora | Beta |
| Azure SQL Database | Alpha |
| GCP SQL | Alpha |


**Beta support** conveys that ReadySet is routinely tested in those contexts. 

**Alpha support** conveys that ReadySet has previously been validated to work in those contexts, but we don't actively check for regressions.
