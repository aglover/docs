# Part 1: Deploy ReadySet

If you created a Consul stack using the ReadySet-provided CloudFormation template, you will need to wait for it to complete. 
Once the stack has reached the `CREATE_COMPLETED` state, copy the `ConsulJoinManagedPolicy` output and provide it as the 
`ConsulJoinManagedPolicyArn` input as a part of launching this stack.

For the next steps, use the ReadySet CloudFormation template link we sent you. 

## Launch ReadySet via CloudFormation
### Step 1: Specify Template
The first page should already be pre-configured for you. You can just click Next at the bottom of the page. Fill in the fields that are blank following the instructions in the gray text. 
### Step 2: Specify Stack Details
Fill in the fields using the guidance below.
| Parameter      | Guidance |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Stack name` | We recommend naming your stack something like "ReadySet".   |
| `VPCID`   | This should be the ID of the VPC that will have  Consul and ReadySet installed.  |
| `VPCCIDR` | Copy the CIDR from the VPC provided in VPCID. To find the CIDR, navigate to the VPC console, find the row corresponding to your selected VPCID, and copy the CIDR.|
| `PrivateSubnet<1, 2, 3>ID` | Fill in the IDs of the subnets referenced in Part 0 Step 2. |
| `BastionSecurityGroupID` | This should be a security group that will be added to all ReadySet instances for access. |
| `KeyPairName` | Paste in the name of the key you copied from Part 0 Step 3. |
| `ConsulJoinManagedPolicyArn` | Paste the IAM Managed Policy ARN you copied from. This is the output from the Consul stack if you used the ReadySet-provided Consul CloudFormation template. |
| `ReadySetAdapterInstanceType` | We recommend setting this to c5.4xlarge for production workloads. This can be changed at a later date but downtime will be required. |
| `ReadySetAdapterNodes` | We recommend setting this to at least 3 for high-availability. |
| `ReadySetServerInstanceType` | We recommend setting this to c5.4xlarge for production workloads. This can be changed at a later date but downtime will be required. |
| `ReadySetServerNodes` | We recommend setting this to at least 3 for high-availability. |
| `ReadySetMonitorInstanceType` | We recommend setting this to c5.4xlarge for production workloads. This can be changed at a later date but downtime will be required. |
| `ReadySetServerVolumeSizeGB` | This is the volume size for storing the base tables. We recommend setting this to the storage size of your RDS instance. |
| `ReadySetMemoryLimitGB` | This is the memory limit for ReadySetServerInstances in GB. We recommend setting this to 80% of the total memory on the selected ReadySetServerInstanceType. |
| `MySQLDatabaseURL` | database connection string of the form `mysql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>` |



### Step 3: Configure Stack Options
Fill in your desired stack options. We highly recommend selecting "Preserve successfully provisioned resources" to allow ReadySet to help debug deployment issues that may arise.

These options are dependent on your company's AWS security policies. We currently do not have a list of all IAM permissions required to deploy these stacks. 

### Step 4: Review
This page provides a review of your Consul setup configurations. 
You must accept the Capabilities acknowledgement before creating your stack.
Once the ReadySet stack has reached the `CREATE_COMPLETED` state, go to the Outputs tab in the ReadySet stack to obtain the following values:
- The value of the key corresponding to `ReadysetDBSecurityGroup` for use in Part 2. 
- The value of the key corresponding to `ReadysetAdapterNLBDNSName` for use in Part 3.
