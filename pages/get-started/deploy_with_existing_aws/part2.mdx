# Part 2: Connect ReadySet to your primary database

1. After successfully deploying ReadySet, connect ReadySet to your database by adding the `ReadysetDBSecurityGroup` to your existing RDS database. 

> You can do this through the AWS RDS console: navigate to the RDS database that you 
> wish to connect to ReadySet. Click the Modify button to edit your RDS instance. Go to Security Groups under Connectivity. 

2. Add the security group created by the ReadySet CloudFormation stack to this database, then click Continue at the bottom of the page.
On the next page, select Apply immediately under Scheduling of modifications. Submit your modifications.

> The `ReadysetDBSecurityGroup` output from the ReadySet stack is the ID of the security group. The RDS console 
> requires you to type in the name of the security group; to find it, navigate to the EC2 Console, Security Groups, 
> filter by ID and copy the name over.

3. Wait about thirty seconds to allow ReadySet to connect to the underlying database. Once that is complete, ReadySet Adapters and Servers will be able to read your database!

Logs will be uploaded to CloudWatch in a Log Group with the same name as the CloudFormation stack. In the Log Stream named 
`readyset`, once you see a message containing "Snapshot finished" then you can move on to Part 3.
