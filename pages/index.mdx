# Overview: ReadySet Distributed SQL Cache

ReadySet is a distributed SQL cache that precomputes the results of prepared statements (parameterized SQL queries) 
and incrementally updates these results as the underlying data in your database changes. 

ReadySet is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres so it can be integrated with your existing application without
code or database changes.
