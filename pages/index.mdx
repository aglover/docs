# ReadySet Distributed SQL Cache 

When dealing with large datasets, complicated queries, or high request volumes, off-the-shelf 
relational databases often face performance problems that can get in the way of a seamless user experience. 
This can be catastrophic for a business â€“ page load delays of even just 1/10th of a second have been shown 
to have an outsized detrimental impact on KPIs like conversion rates, and failure to handle spikes in usage 
patterns could lead to websites going down during critical sales periods (e.g. during flash sales or Black Friday).

Developers therefore rarely rely on relational databases alone to meet SLAs. Instead, they denormalize data or build 
infrastructure around read replicas and custom query caching layers on top of Redis or Memcached. These approaches 
ultimately incur significant engineering overhead, have high maintenance costs, introduce operational complexity, 
and often even increase risk of failures and outages.

<Bleed>! 

ReadySet is a distributed SQL cache that precomputes the results of prepared statements (parameterized SQL queries) 
and incrementally updates these results as the underlying data in your database changes. ReadySet is wire-compatible with
MySQL and Postgres.
