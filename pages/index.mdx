# ReadySet: Distributed SQL Cache

ReadySet is a distributed SQL cache that automatically keeps query results fresh based on changes to your primary database.
ReadySet is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres so it can be integrated with your existing application without
code or database changes.
