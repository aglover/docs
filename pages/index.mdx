# ReadySet
ReadySet is a distributed SQL cache that precomputes the results of prepared statements (i.e. parameterized SQL 
queries) and incrementally updates these results over time as the underlying data in your database changes. ReadySet 
is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres so it can be integrated with your existing application without code or database changes.
